# MultiBot
MultiBot is a project where I add whatever features I want to. The reason I call it MultiBot, is because it will do multiple things. It's a discord bot that can provide too many things to do. Eventually, I plan on making this bot so ridiculously feature creepy.

## Music Features
Initially, I am working with music APIs to get some general music data. A list of planned music APIs for use are:
* LastFM
* Spotify
* Genius

## Future Work
I have a ton of plans. As long as I don't have a shortage of APIs to use, the sky is the limit. I don't want to only use APIs, but also work with the data gathered from the API. I enjoy data analysis, so I plan on returning some statistics of the data gathered in a nice visual package.
